simplify ruy ' s main loop . most of the next_ * business was unnecessary complication . this code didn ' t know whether it wanted to hide latency of an atomic increment ( 60 cycles ) or of a block coords computation ( comparable ) . now it ' s more intentional about hiding the atomic increment latency , because that ' s the one instruction here that will always have high latency ; for the rest , we can only hope that the compiler will exploit any opportunity to inline the block computation and distribute its instructions so as to hide some of the latency .
