group . hash is an array ( previously available as ` group . _hash ` , but protected ) into which you can add any of its children via ` group . addtohash ` and ` group . removefromhash ` . only children of the group can be added to and removed from the hash . the hash is used automatically by arcade physics in order to perform non z - index based destructive sorting . however if you don ' t use arcade physics , or it isn ' t a physics enabled group , then you can use the hash to perform your own sorting and filtering of group children without touching their z - index ( and therefore display draw order ) .
